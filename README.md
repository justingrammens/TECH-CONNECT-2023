Slides and Examples From My [Scope Creep: Damned if I Do, Damned if I Don’t](https://mntech.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/2023-TC-Agenda_v16.pdf) presentationat at MNTech's [TechConnect 2023](https://mntech.org/tech-connect-2023/).

While everyone likes to share successes, let’s discuss the reality of software development. Projects are messy with lots of competing interests and challenges. One of these challenges that comes up often is scope creep. As software developers, we can be pulled in many different directions to not only help make the best product that we can, but stay focused on the scope of what’s expected. Sometimes your job feels like: “Damned If I Do, Damned If I Don’t”. Let’s discuss the reality of the situation and some techniques and tools to help.
